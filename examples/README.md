# Ising Model
- The [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) is a mathematical model of interacting particles with binary (spin up or down) degrees of freedom, for example magnetic moments in a ferromagnetic material. This is a simple implamentation of this model that produces an animation of the spin lattice in the terminal:
